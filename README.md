3. Execute schema: `sql/schemas/01_supabase_schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
4. Generate sample data: `python src/data_generator.py`
5. Create ML features: Execute ML optimization queries in Supabase

### **Run Analytics Dashboard**
```bash
# Launch interactive dashboard
streamlit run dashboard_working.py

# Train ML models (optional - for advanced features)
python -c "
from src.ml_models import CustomerChurnPredictor
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
connection = os.getenv('SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL')
model = CustomerChurnPredictor(connection)
results = model.train_model()
print('🤖 ML Model trained successfully!')
"
```

## 📈 Sample Analytics Queries

### **Customer Lifetime Value with ML Features**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_tier,
    COUNT(*) as customers,
    AVG(total_spent) as avg_clv,
    AVG(days_since_last_order) as avg_recency,
    AVG(orders_last_90_days) as recent_activity
FROM customer_ml_features
GROUP BY customer_tier
ORDER BY avg_clv DESC;
```

### **Advanced Product Performance with Predictions**
```sql
WITH product_performance AS (
    SELECT 
        p.product_name,
        p.brand,
        SUM(oi.quantity) as units_sold,
        SUM(oi.line_total) as revenue,
        COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_customers,
        AVG(oi.unit_price - p.unit_cost) as avg_profit_margin
    FROM products p
    JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    WHERE o.order_status IN ('confirmed', 'shipped', 'delivered')
    GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.brand
)
SELECT 
    *,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) as revenue_rank,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) as performance_quartile
FROM product_performance
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```
